Modify the PocketSphinx codebase to be compatible with MicroPython, ensuring that the required dependencies are also ported. Remove the default model files from the PocketSphinx repository, as we will be providing the necessary language model (lm), acoustic model (hmm), and pronunciation dictionary (dict) files separately. Collaborate with the development team to address any issues, bugs, or compatibility problems that may arise during the porting process. Document the porting process, including any modifications made to the original codebase and any considerations specific to MicroPython and the target microcontrollers. Requirements: Strong proficiency in C++ & Python programming language, with a deep understanding of its syntax and features. Experience working with embedded systems and microcontrollers, particularly with MicroPython. Familiarity with speech recognition concepts and algorithms. Solid understanding of the PocketSphinx Python module, its dependencies, and the LiveSpeech class. Proficient in analyzing existing codebases, identifying dependencies, and making necessary modifications for porting. Ability to work independently and efficiently, meeting project deadlines and delivering high-quality results. Excellent problem-solving skills and attention to detail. Good communication skills, both written and verbal, to collaborate effectively with the development team. Note: Please keep in mind that porting a complex module like PocketSphinx to MicroPython can be a challenging task, especially considering the limited resources and capabilities of microcontrollers. It is essential to evaluate the feasibility of the project thoroughly before committing to the porting effort.","Product Management, Market Analysis, Marketing Strategy, Critical Thinking Skills, Microsoft Excel, Business Analysis, Content Writing, Product Roadmap, Market Research, Project Management",Expert,4384,seeking skilled micropython porting engineer assist porting pocketsphinx speech recognition module standard python micropython primary target platforms porting effort raspberry pi pico rp analyze pocketsphinx python module understand structure dependencies key functionality focus livespeech class evaluate level effort required port module micropython assess challenges limitations posed target modify pocketsphinx codebase compatible micropython ensuring required dependencies ported remove default model files pocketsphinx repository providing necessary language model lm acoustic model hmm pronunciation dictionary dict files separately collaborate development team address issues bugs compatibility problems arise porting process document porting process including modifications original codebase considerations specific micropython target requirements strong proficiency python programming language deep understanding syntax features experience working embedded systems particularly micropython familiarity speech recognition concepts algorithms solid understanding pocketsphinx python module dependencies livespeech class proficient analyzing existing codebases identifying dependencies making necessary modifications porting ability work independently efficiently meeting project deadlines delivering high quality results excellent problem solving skills attention good communication skills written verbal collaborate effectively development team note mind porting complex module like pocketsphinx micropython challenging task especially considering limited resources capabilities essential evaluate feasibility project thoroughly committing porting effort,Expert-MicroPython Porting Engineer-seeking skilled micropython porting engineer assist porting pocketsphinx speech recognition module standard python micropython primary target platforms porting effort raspberry pi pico rp analyze pocketsphinx python module understand structure dependencies key functionality focus livespeech class evaluate level effort required port module micropython assess challenges limitations posed target modify pocketsphinx codebase compatible micropython ensuring required dependencies ported remove default model files pocketsphinx repository providing necessary language model lm acoustic model hmm pronunciation dictionary dict files separately collaborate development team address issues bugs compatibility problems arise porting process document porting process including modifications original codebase considerations specific micropython target requirements strong proficiency python programming language deep understanding syntax features experience working embedded systems particularly micropython familiarity speech recognition concepts algorithms solid understanding pocketsphinx python module dependencies livespeech class proficient analyzing existing codebases identifying dependencies making necessary modifications porting ability work independently efficiently meeting project deadlines delivering high quality results excellent problem solving skills attention good communication skills written verbal collaborate effectively development team note mind porting complex module like pocketsphinx micropython challenging task especially considering limited resources capabilities essential evaluate feasibility project thoroughly committing porting effort,Pocketsphinx speech recognition module is being portable to micropython.

Senior Android Video Developer for Videogrid Project,"Dear freelancers, we are looking for a Senior Android Kotlin developer who specializes in creating and optimizing video displays in a mobile application. Skills: Exoplayer, preloading, buffering, Jetpack Compose Media We are currently developing an application that features a grid of video items, designed to show 3 columns and an infinite rows of videos, sourced from an external domain. Like on a TikTok profile page, take a look at this random page: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bgVEE1rJAxG4oshZh5G_EoS17Xd3duVr/view?usp=sharing The video items are 1 second long and they bounce back and forth. Let us discuss how to best implement this. It is easy to create a Grid with video items in Android. But let us make the user experience flawless and without interruptions. We have to preload the first milliseconds of the video items, so that when the user clicks on them, the video instantly shows up. It will also require delicate buffering. Things we tried so far: 1. ChatGPT does not create a functional Grid and it is not the best for creating UI elements, yet. Also it is limited to 09/2021 while Jetpack Compose was introduced only 07/2021 and the latest Browser plugin does not successfully catch all the recent information. 2. ReactNative is not performant enough for this task and the video grid is laggy. Ideally, let us use declarative Jetpack Compose as it seems to have better performance. Can you propose a solution? Let us handle video rendering and optimization on mobile applications, specifically in a grid layout. We can provide sample videos. This is just the first step. Ideally, we will work with you long-term for several other screens (which are easier).

Advisor on building a Discord server experience using bots,"We are looking for a software engineer who is experienced with Discord bot development and can work with us 1:1 in real time, instructing us on how to set up a new Discord server experience. We will ask the expert a couple questions to validate their knowledge before hiring. The expert must have demonstrated existing work building Discord bots. We will be integrating with two existing Discord bots (image generative AI) into an existing server. But instead of using /commend prompts of separate bots, we want to enable users to use buttons and reaction emojis to achieve the desired responses with just one bot. We want to create specific channels for each user and make certain users/bots invisible from the user list. We have not seen anyone do these so are not sure if these can be achieved by simply configuring Discord server settings or need custom scripts. Hence, we would like to hire an experienced Discord expert who can meet us over shared-screen calls, instruct us what to do, charge by the hours. The actions will be taken on our side, instead of giving the tasks to a freelancer to try on their own. We can split the project in different task stages. If there are something the expert does not know and cannot continue to the next task, we can find another person to continue, although we would love for the same person to help us finish all the tasks. This is the beginning stage of a potentially long-term collaboration. Beyond the Discord bot, we are interested in finding someone we can hire for future long-term projects.

The project is expected to take less than one month to complete. The ideal candidate should have a strong understanding of API integration and be able to work with PGSharp Feeds API to extract the required data. Additionally, the candidate should be familiar with automation techniques and be able to develop a system to automate the data extraction process. The successful candidate should be able to demonstrate their experience in similar projects. Please provide links to past completed projects, showcasing your skills in API integration, data extraction, and data scraping. If you are confident in your ability to complete this project, please submit a proposal outlining your approach to the project, including your estimated timeline and budget. We look forward to hearing from you. Note: Some of the content in this job post may have been auto-generated using advanced AI. Details: The app is PGSharp (you can google it) It has a feature called ""Feeds"" Those feeds contain pokemon and their coordinates. The premium feature of Feeds allows you to filter specific pokemon, with specific ivs/levels etc. I want to call that API (with a premium membership, it's not a problem) and retrieve the results in . Long story short: retrieve the API's response, decrypt it and print it in . I should see pokemons and their latitude/longitude coordinates in that response In Detail My request is for the Pokemon GO Cheating app called ""PGSharp"", found at https://www.pgsharp.com/ My request will have to be done using a premium key of PGSharp. I paid one for you, use it for your tests ; 2E903076-C542-4A55-AA8A-4FA1AD6C9E5D Before doing any of the steps below, make sure to activate PGSharp by clicking on the ""star"" overlay, ""Settings"", ""Activate"". Use the key I gave you above. The request is from the ""Feeds"" section of PGSharp, found in the same ""star menu"" Once Feeds are clicked, click the ""+"" sign on top right. In this menu, you have a lot of settings such as ""Level"", ""IV"", ""Pokemon"" etc. These settings are used to request pokemon coordinates from PGSharp. Click ""Ok"" to close the menu, then click the ""target"" (or ""aim"") sort of button, to see the list of pokemon. Now a list of pokemon is showing up. I will send a screenshot of what that ""list"" looks like. Your job: In , send that same request with all the different infos (level, iv, pokemon and all the other stuff) to PGSharp servers in order to get the list of pokemons Once you got that list, print to the console the pokemon name (or pokemon ID) as well as it's latitude/longitude coordinates.

Tax Attorney Needed For IRS & FL DOR Issues,"I need an experienced tax attorney to help with tax issues with the IRS and (ideally) State of Florida DOR from a business I was a partner in years ago. Summary: Business started in 2014 My business partner (CEO) financed the company and handled all financial matters. In 2017 we brought on an investor who assumed the role of CFO, and brought to light the fact that my business partner had significantly underpaid state tax and payroll tax. In 2020, the company and I went separate ways. As part of my buyout agreement, I was promised indemnity from all tax and debt issues. My former business partner (a pathological liar) assured me everything was being taken care of and that I was no longer on the hook for the debts. He's recently hired counsel for the company, himself, and me, who's told me that the IRS has assessed over $300k to us both personally, and it looks like my business partner changed my contact information so I thought that I was off the hook with them. He's also told me Florida DOR hasn't mentioned me in any of the interactions and seems to solely be focused on the company and my former partner, he doesn't want to bring me up in case that puts me on their radar unnecessarily. In 2021, I took my former business partner to court and found out that he embezzled significant amounts of money and had accounts I was unaware of. I feel there's a conflict of interest with the counsel he hired representing both of us, so I'm looking for my own. I have witnesses and testimony that I had no control over finances, and hope that I can prove that to the IRS (and DOR if necessary).","Sales, Administrative Support, Project Management, Business Analysis, Marketing Strategy, Data Entry, Relationship Management",Expert,27267,need experienced tax attorney help tax issues irs ideally state florida dor business partner years ago summary business started business partner ceo financed company handled financial matters brought investor assumed role cfo brought light fact business partner significantly underpaid state tax payroll tax company went separate ways buyout agreement promised indemnity tax debt issues business partner pathological liar assured taken care longer hook debts recently hired counsel company told irs assessed personally looks like business partner changed contact information thought hook told florida dor mentioned interactions solely focused company partner want bring case puts radar unnecessarily took business partner court embezzled significant amounts money accounts unaware feel conflict counsel hired representing looking witnesses testimony control finances hope prove irs dor necessary,Expert-Tax Attorney Needed For IRS & FL DOR Issues-need experienced tax attorney help tax issues irs ideally state florida dor business partner years ago summary business started business partner ceo financed company handled financial matters brought investor assumed role cfo brought light fact business partner significantly underpaid state tax payroll tax company went separate ways buyout agreement promised indemnity tax debt issues business partner pathological liar assured taken care longer hook debts recently hired counsel company told irs assessed personally looks like business partner changed contact information thought hook told florida dor mentioned interactions solely focused company partner want bring case puts radar unnecessarily took business partner court embezzled significant amounts money accounts unaware feel conflict counsel hired representing looking witnesses testimony control finances hope prove irs dor necessary,An experienced tax attorney is needed for IRS and Florida Department of Revenue issues.

A REAL personal assistant who knows what they are doing,"Need a REAL personal assistant. I probably should hire one for our physical location, but I believe in outsourcing and globalization as a whole, so this is what I have decided I'm going to pursue until I get my desired results. I am a single father, who's raised his son on his own and he just got accepted to the top universities in America at the age of 13 and starts in the fall. I own 9 companies and properties they operate on, so I have a lot coming at me at all times. I understand the rarity of my trajectory and life in general and I need someone who can keep up and is flexible, which I find is a problem. I travel a lot and have a crazy life. No investors or partners and I'm Delaware's largest powersports dealer at the age of 39. I own car dealerships, collision centers, car rental agencies, service shops, and farms. I fly all over the world, ride motorcycles, power sports, go where I want, do what I want, and live how I want. Like a sour patch kid though I have absolute discipline and balance. I read 80 books a year, don't drink, smoke, no drugs, no meat, no caffeine, no carbonated beverages. Up at 4:30 every morning, strict lights out. Workout every single day and never miss, and I use a lot of production apps, and organizational lists. I insist on keeping a clean and organized email inbox, home, work space, car, and being a tidy and clean person in general. Church every Sunday, I never miss, pray multiple times every day, and have my own views, not just those of the church, as I understand nothing is translated perfectly over thousands of years and I believe everyone has their own journey and path. I do this for me, so I don't concern myself with others' ways of doing things, so to me I am completely fine with people who don't believe, have different beliefs, etc. I am tough as nails and take no nonsense from anyone. The people who know me best can attribute to this, it is a true leadership quality. I do not sway my morals or disciplines for anyone or anything and I am a rock many people have broken themselves against the years who have tried to change me or get me to lower my standards. So I have no problems going directly at company CEO's, vendors, customers, or employees, if they violate me or my moral code. The world is moving faster and I have more on my plate. My employees are often like trying to herd stray cats, and I am a big believer in results and results alone. I have been going through and changing at a lot of stores as the tech environment is changing and so is the business landscape. I have always grown revenues annually and been profitable and I intend to keep it that way. If I plan on growing and being one of the brightest stars to emerge from my state of Delaware then I know I will always be in some state of change, so changing and adaptability is important. I want someone who is my Jarvis to Tony Stark. Someone who knows what I need done and over time and years can mold with me and help me on my journey. With that said, I have seen some of the not so great things in outsourcing and the ""gig"" economy in recent years, so if you're one of ""those"" outsourcers, then I'm just not interested. If you're trying to run multiple ""hustles"" and jobs, and just want to stay in compliance and use mouse jigglers and short cutting tactics then I don't judge you, but you will burn underneath my light and people will flush you out for the fraud you are because you can't beat the results of actual hard work. There is plenty enough room for advancement in pay with me, so I expect my employee to be an actual full time person. So, I am paying this to onboard someone for one month and see if it's a good fit and then we will discuss the pay, etc, which will come in at $1500 a month and raises given accordingly and bonuses accordingly. So what do you need to be? One, you need to be someone who can handle my personality and ambitions. I don't play small. Now, does that work with an introvert personality? Possibly. Does it go well with an extrovert? Possibly. I don't know as it's always like trying to hit a moving target. However, you need to be someone who is results oriented. Someone organized and adaptable. A battery ""CHARGER"" not ""DRAINER."" A good person who only needs to be told things once or twice, no more than that. Only non compliant employees fall into that category and I don't want anymore of those. You have to want to improve your own life and strive to be better in all things. A thirst for knowledge is important and someone who knows how to ""maneuver"" through life. My knowledge and understanding of life is of more value than most hard currency, so you need to want this job for more than just a monetary perspective. I look forward to working with you, future assistant, whoever you are. Please send a personalized video and/or message. Any generic or bot created responses will not even be reviewed by me.

Analysis of Nvidia stock,"Requires an understanding of: moats/pricing power, DCF and NPV, willingness to learn about semiconductor industry and AI creation and use (training and inference). This is to inform my personal investing. I have a huge list of questions I want answered on Nvidia. The depth of research plus clarity of thought I need is very high. When you're doing the research, you'll use either Loom or Quicktime to record your screen (camera and mic can be off) and you'll add timestamps when you switch between different questions so that if I want to see the data that went into one of your answers, I can go and watch that part of the process. Example questions: * Graph of future projected revenue by segment based purely on what's priced in (and indicating what discount rate that's based on in each of the future years) * How does the preference for CUDA over ROCm vary between large scale training and large scale inference needs (cuda powers nvidia, rocm powers amd, i want to know do people creating large AI need cuda as well as people running large AI systems that they already trained need cuda, or is it just needed for only one of creating or running and amd could be used for the other) * Looking for examples of investors who talk about owning the stock from online communities and seeing how their comments about it have changed over time, for 10 example owners * If there were 100 nvidia shareholders in a room, a representative sample, how would those break down (and consider end customers, i.e. the people who hold the accounts at fidelity, not ""fidelity"") - kinda like this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3nllBT9ACg","Industry Knowledge, Financial Analysis",Intermediate,56019,requires understanding moats pricing power dcf npv willingness learn semiconductor industry ai creation use training inference inform personal investing huge list questions want answered nvidia depth research plus clarity thought need high research use loom quicktime record screen camera mic add timestamps switch different questions want data went answers watch process example questions graph future projected revenue segment based purely priced indicating discount rate based future years preference cuda rocm vary large scale training large scale inference needs cuda powers nvidia rocm powers amd want know people creating large ai need cuda people running large ai systems trained need cuda needed creating running amd looking examples investors talk owning stock online communities seeing comments changed time example owners nvidia shareholders room representative sample break consider end customers people hold accounts fidelity fidelity kinda like video https www youtube com watch nllbt acg,Intermediate-Analysis of Nvidia stock-requires understanding moats pricing power dcf npv willingness learn semiconductor industry ai creation use training inference inform personal investing huge list questions want answered nvidia depth research plus clarity thought need high research use loom quicktime record screen camera mic add timestamps switch different questions want data went answers watch process example questions graph future projected revenue segment based purely priced indicating discount rate based future years preference cuda rocm vary large scale training large scale inference needs cuda powers nvidia rocm powers amd want know people creating large ai need cuda people running large ai systems trained need cuda needed creating running amd looking examples investors talk owning stock online communities seeing comments changed time example owners nvidia shareholders room representative sample break consider end customers people hold accounts fidelity fidelity kinda like video https www youtube com watch nllbt acg,"Analysis of Nvidia stock requires understanding moats pricing power, willingness to learn semiconductor industry, knowledge of semiconductors and people running large ai systems trained need cuda needed to create running.

Pinescript Screener tool and Backtester,I’m looking to create two things in Pinescript: I would like to create a screener that is able to go back and find stocks that hit certain criteria from the trading day and then back test my strategy on those stocks. In terms of the strategies they are all focused on candlestick patters on certain volume and % changes. I would like to create a screener that finds candle patterns of up to 5 candles where I can set specific volume and % change against each candle. For instance: Open Candle 1 to Close Candle 1 - 4%-22% with 1000+ Volume Candle 2 Close greater than Candle 1 Close - 4%-22% with 1000+ Volume Candle 3 Close greater than Candle 2 Close - 0.1%-22% with 1000+ Volume Candle 4 Close greater than Candle 3 Close - 0.1%-22% with 1000+ Volume I would also like to create the same screener that includes total price x volume. So for instance: Open Candle 1 to Close Candle 1 - 4%-22% with $30000+ PxV Candle 2 Close greater than Candle 1 Close - 4%-22% with $30000+ PxV Candle 3 Close greater than Candle 2 Close - 0.1%-22% with $30000+ PxV Candle 4 Close greater than Candle 3 Close - 0.1%-22% with $30000+ PxV Once the screen has identified stocks that meet the criteria from the day I would then like to backtest the strategy whereby I can set when I would buy and sell. For instance by at Candle 4 Close Sell 10 bars later. Would you be able to quote me on this project in terms of the screener and the backtested as separate? Also how much it would be to walk me through the screener and implement onto my platform.,"Machine Learning Model, MQL 4, Bot Development, App Development, TradeStation, Deep Learning, Deep Neural Network, Artificial Neural Network, Mathematics, PHP, NinjaTrader, API Integration, Forex Trading, MetaTrader 4",Expert,56033,looking create things pinescript like create screener able stocks hit certain criteria trading day test strategy stocks terms strategies focused candlestick patters certain volume changes like create screener finds candle patterns candles set specific volume change candle instance open candle close candle volume candle close greater candle close volume candle close greater candle close volume candle close greater candle close volume like create screener includes total price volume instance open candle close candle pxv candle close greater candle close pxv candle close greater candle close pxv candle close greater candle close pxv screen identified stocks meet criteria day like backtest strategy set buy sell instance candle close sell bars later able quote project terms screener backtested separate walk screener implement platform,Expert-Pinescript Screener tool and Backtester-looking create things pinescript like create screener able stocks hit certain criteria trading day test strategy stocks terms strategies focused candlestick patters certain volume changes like create screener finds candle patterns candles set specific volume change candle instance open candle close candle volume candle close greater candle close volume candle close greater candle close volume candle close greater candle close volume like create screener includes total price volume instance open candle close candle pxv candle close greater candle close pxv candle close greater candle close pxv candle close greater candle close pxv screen identified stocks meet criteria day like backtest strategy set buy sell instance candle close sell bars later able quote project terms screener backtested separate walk screener implement platform,"Pinescript is an expert-pinescript screener tool.
